# ExtendedExpressionCalc
An extended version of the SimpleExpressionCalc
The test suite is the same as for the SimpleExpressionCalc.
First, create a file called `testFile` and add some test expressions to it (one per line). A default one is provided.
Then execute the command `python testCalc.py` to run the calculator against the test expressions.
